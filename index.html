    <h1>Privacy Policy for URL Replacer</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 9 October 2024</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to <strong>URL Replacer</strong>! This Privacy Policy outlines how our Chrome extension interacts with your data to provide its functionality. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your personal information remains secure.</p>

    <h2>Information We Process</h2>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <ul>

        <li><strong>No Data Transmission:</strong> No data is sent to external servers or third parties. All processing is done in real-time within your browser.</li>
        <li><strong>User-Defined Settings:</strong> The URLs you specify for replacement are stored locally using Chrome's storage API. These settings are not shared or transmitted.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p><strong>URL Replacer</strong> requires the following permissions to function:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>activeTab:</strong> Allows the extension to interact with the currently active tab to inject scripts for URL replacement.</li>
        <li><strong>scripting:</strong> Enables the extension to execute scripts within the context of web pages.</li>
        <li><strong>storage:</strong> Used to save and retrieve your URL replacement configurations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Security</h2>
